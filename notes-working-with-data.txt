tophat questions:
what are three main branches of machine learning:
- supervised, unsupervised, reinforcement learning
what is labeled data?
--he had some rather weird answer choices, we'll have to wait and see what he says is the answer
one-hot-encoding is an example structure that can be used for linear regression?
-- again, very weird
what type of algorithm would you use to segment your customers into multiple groups?
- clustering



*********ACTUAL START OF MATERIAL***********

- no data, no learning
-- purely data driven

- three potential challenges of machine learning
-- bad algorithm: the algorithm is not good enough for this particular problem
-- bad data: data is not good enough
-- bad evaluation: metrics aren't indicative of future usage


THE BAD DATA PROBLEM:
- the "bad data problem" will be the focus of the lecture today
example of bad evaluation:
- sibling blaring music in background
- when trying to measure success of removing noise from signal, the metric you use may not be good

THE UNREASONABLE EFFECTIVENESS OF DATA:
- in school, algorithms are the focus
- in work, it is often the data that matters most
- microsoft researches showed that different algorithms performed almost identically all on a complex NLP problem once enough data was given


MAIN CHALLENGES OF ML
1. insufficient quantity of training data
2. nonerpresentative training data
- the data you have *must* be representative of the data you expect to see
-- otherwise, you wont be able to generalize
-sampling bias
-- the data collected, sampled, is bias/ not varied enough
-- if you poll only republicans who they are voting for, you would be convinced that trump was going to win the election
3. poor quality data
- often need to clean data in this scenario
-- discard or remove outliers
-- ignore missing features/attributes, a particular instance, or fill in values
-- find/collect replacement data
4. irrelevant features
- garbage in, garbage out
- feature engineering may be needed
-- selection: select most useful features
-- extraction: combine existing features
-- creation: create new features from new data
